<p style="font-family:courier;color:rgb(240, 136, 17);text-align:center"><strong><em>BUT FIRST I WILL NEED YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO NOTIFY YOU OF FURTHER UPDATES</em></strong></p>
<div class="container">
<p class="glass"><p>So I used to call myself a Christian for years and not truly know who Jesus Christ is, it was at the age of 16-18 or 17-18 that I truly came to know who Jesus Christ is, so I was at a particular church and over a period of time I felt this strong influence “Brandon this is not church” I didn’t know that this was the Holy Spirit back then but glory be to God now I know, during those times I had gotten frustrated going to church not being on fire for God,* not being passionate about God,* not seeing healing take place, and demons getting casted out in accordance to The Word of God: 
<br>Mark 16:17-18 KJV
	<br>
17 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;
18 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</p>
<p>I also didn’t know that a woman shouldn’t be a pastor, but now I know Glory be to God according to The Word of God: 
 <br>1 Timothy 3:2-5 KJV
	<br>
2 A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;
3 Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;
4 One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;
5 (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)</p>
<p>so when I had decided to let the Holy Spirit lead me into all truth (John 16:13) that’s the moment my life completely changed, it’s like God put me in a slingshot and catapult me into my destiny, I was addicted to porn and lied alot, I was depressed some if not most of the times and satan had a stronghold in my life but Jesus Christ broke those chains off me and set me free from all evil because I desired to seek him diligently by the Holy Spirit according to Hebrew 11:6. Ever since I allowed the Holy Spirit to guide in me every way and not just some, every time I read the Word of God I understand because according to The Word of God:
<br>John 14:26 KJV
	<br>
26 But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.
so principle every time you read God’s Word ask God for the interpretation of his Word by the Holy Spirit because it’s the Holy Spirit that’s going to teach you about Jesus Christ and lead you into all truth according to The Word of God in
John 16:13.</p>
<p>So as time progressed I was baptized with the Holy Spirit and fire, I received my prayer language/started praying* in tongues, Jesus Christ used me to heal people and deliver people from spiritual bondage, to break generational curses off a person/people and according to Jesus Christ I prophesied and it came to past pinpoint exactly as the Lord had instructed me to and it’s all because of Jesus Christ and my obedience to him. 
have you ever wondered why so many young people and people in general are suicidal and depressed?.* because they are filling their minds with demonic influence and/or having sex before marriage, according to The Word Of God they can be freed from spiritual bondage because according The Word Of  God:
<br>Ecclesiastes 7:5 KJV
	<br>
5 It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.
1 Corinthians 6:16 KJV
16 What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.</p>
<p>So whenever a person has sex they become one flesh and outside of the God ordained way which is marriage that is a devastating thing; why? because when two persons become one flesh/soul tie they are joined together spiritually and diseases are prone to happening and any problems both persons may have had spiritually has now become apart of the both persons so their problems spiritually are fused together henceforth such persons in this bondage by the devil start to experience evil attacks from the spirit of: suicide, anxiety, confusion and generational curses and all different types of evil start to manifest in their life because the devil has a legal right in the life of a person outside of the will of God because according to The Word of God: 
<br>Proverbs 26:1-3 KJV
	<br>
26 As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool.
2 As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.
3 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back.</p>
<p>so this scripture according to The Holy Spirit means that the devil has to have a legal right/covenant in a persons life for evil to befall them/to curse them, do you  remember what happened to Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden, the devil had to form a legal right/covenant for evil to befall them, do you remember what had happened with Job? the devil presented himself before God to destroy Job but God didn't allow him to destroy him (Job), God allowed him to detrimentally attack Job but not kill him and God had restored everything Job had lost and more, so Satan has to try get God's image/people to circumvent the rules, the ordinances/the principles that God has set in place to keep/preserve, prosper* them (God's image) in order for him (Satan) to destroy them/cause evil to befall them. 
Whenever a person lacks the knowledge of God's Word evil will always befall them; why? because according to The Word of God in:
<br>Hosea 4:6 KJV
	<br>
6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.
but if such a person desires to submit to Jesus Christ in all their ways and not just some they will be prosperous in every aspect of life; why? because according to The Word of God in:
<br>Proverbs 11:8-10 KJV
	<br>
8 The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.
9 An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.
10 When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, there is shouting.</p>
<p>so through knowledge shall the just (the true believer/follower of Jesus Christ) be delivered from spiritual bondage, because things happen spiritually before it happens physically for example do you remember when God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Abraham and formed a covenant with him in his dream according to
The Word of God in:
	<br>
Genesis 15:12-18 KJV
	<br>
12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18 In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:
so here's the principle according to the Holy Spirit, God can form a covenant with you in your dream as well the devil seeks to form a covenant with you, so covenants good or bad can be formed and a covenant can be formed in a dream as seen in the example above according to The Word of God, but someone that lacks knowledge of God's Word is subject to the schemes of the devil/the enemy prospering against them, according to the Word of God in:
<br>Ecclesiastes 9:5-6 KJV
	<br>
5 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. 6 Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.</p>
<p>So according to the Holy Spirit when a person dies they have no more proportion under the sun that means they  are no longer available on earth in no way, so when a person receives a dream of their dead relative giving them food or talking to them or touching them that is the devil masquerading himself as his/her relative seeking to form a covenant with that person and the moment he/she shows any form of agreement to that "relative" which is the devil he/she has just formed a covenant with the devil and as result the manifestation of such a covenant with the devil can be:  stillbirth, the death of a family member, a generational curse or any form of evil.
However all forms of evil won't prosper against those who are in the will of God because according
The Word of God in:
<br>Isaiah 54:17 KJV
	<br>
17 No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>so to conclude my testimony; according to Jesus Christ it is only when I started/decided to acknowledge the Lord in all my ways by the Holy Spirit that I truly came to know who Jesus Christ is, I now know The Truth and The Truth has set me free according to The Word of God in:
<br>John 14:6 KJV
	<br>
6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
<br>John 8:32 KJV
	<br>
32 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</p>
